# üêá jump-to-project-root

Simple ZSH utility to jump back to the nearest project root.

### What does it solve?

- Do you work in an monorepo containing multiple projects?
- Does each project contain its own multitude of components (e.g. backend vs frontend vs test-suite vs build-context), each with their own root?
- Do you find yourself frequently navigating up the directory tree to the correct level to run context-specific commands? (e.g. `npm i` vs `go test ./...` vs `docker-compose up` vs `make build`)

This tool helps you quickly navigate to the nearest project root, so you can run context-specific commands without having to think about where you are in the directory tree.

### How does it work

A project root is defined as a directory that contain one or many "markers" of a project root. This is the default list of glob patterns used to identify markers:

```
.git
Makefile
go.(mod|sum)
main.go
composer.(json|lock)
package.(json|lock)
Cargo.toml
.env
Gemfile
Dockerfile
docker-compose.y(a|)ml
README.md
```

If you are already at a project root, `jump-to-project-root` will bring you to the next nearest project root.

## Setup

Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/bezhermoso/jump-to-project-root.git ~/.local/share/zsh/jump-to-project-root

```

Add the `functions` directory of this repo to your `fpath`:

```sh
# Add to fpath
fpath+=('~/.local/share/zsh/jump-to-project-root/functions')

# RECOMMENDED: Assign to a short alias e.g.
# mnemonic: (j)ump to (r)oot of project
alias jr=jump-to-project-root
```

## How to override the project marker list

You can override the entire list by defining an `JUMP_TO_PROJECT_ROOT_GLOB_MARKERS` environment variable e.g.

```sh
# Must be an array
export JUMP_TO_PROJECT_ROOT_GLOB_MARKERS=(
  ".git"
  "env.yaml"
  "index.php"
  "docker-compose.y(a|)ml"
  "webpack.config.js"
  "composer.(json|lock)"
  "package.(json|lock)"
  "README.md"
)
```

### Marker spec

This tool uses Zsh's globbing capabilities to determine whether a directory contains any of the markers. Each entry in
`JUMP_TO_PROJECT_ROOT_GLOB_MARKERS` must be valid glob pattern. It is **case-sensitive** e.g. `README.md` will _not_
match `readme.md`

See `man zshexpn` for details on how Zsh glob patterns work.
